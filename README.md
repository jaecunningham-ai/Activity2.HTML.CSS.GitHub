# Activity 2 — Simple Website

This repo contains a minimal multi‑page site built with semantic HTML and a single CSS file.

## Files
- `index.html` — home page
- `about.html` — about page (uses second personal image)
- `projects.html` — projects (links to external learning resources)
- `css/styles.css` — shared stylesheet
- `img/jae-portrait.svg` and `img/jae-travel.svg` — placeholders (replace with **your own** photos)

## Replace the placeholders
1. Put two personal, professional images in the `img/` folder (for example: `jae-portrait.jpg` and `jae-travel.jpg`).
2. Update the `<img src>` paths and `alt` text in the HTML files to match your filenames.
3. Keep content professional and ensure you own the image rights.

## Publish via GitHub
1. Create a **private** repository named something like `activity-2-simple-website`.
2. Add `svlasnik-uno` as a **Collaborator** (Settings → Collaborators).
3. Using GitHub Desktop:
   - **Add Local Repository**: Choose this folder.
   - **Commit**: Write a message like `Initial commit` and commit to `main`.
   - **Publish/Push** to GitHub.
4. After any changes, **commit** and **push** again to update.
5. Submit the **link to your GitHub repo** on Canvas as required.

## Accessibility checklist
- Every image has descriptive `alt` text.
- Heading levels are hierarchical (`h1` → `h2` → `h3`).
- Color contrast passes basic readability (light text on dark background).
- Links have :hover styles and clear focus states by default.
